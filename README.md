# ðŸŒ¿ Crop Health Assessment and Disease Detection via
 Attention-Mechanism and Smart Sensing in Precision
 Farming

An end-to-end IoT + ML system to detect plant diseases using deep learning, advise fertilizer/pesticide, and enable real-time monitoring via mobile app and ESP32-CAM integration.

##  Features

-  Leaf disease detection using YOLOv5 + Selective Feature Refinement (SFR)
-  Flutter mobile app with upload/camera + advisory UI
-  ESP32-CAM for field-based image capture and inference
-  Flask REST API to handle predictions
-  Advisory for fertilizer, pesticide, and precautions
-  Soil/humidity sensor integration for irrigation management

##  Workflow

1. User uploads plant image via **Flutter app** or **ESP32-CAM**.
2. Flask backend receives image â†’ processes it with **YOLOv5 + SFR**.
3. Detected disease is matched with **advisory.json**.
4. JSON response sent with:
    -  Disease Name
    -  Recommended Fertilizer
    -  Pesticide
    -  Precautions

---

##  Flutter App UI

- Camera and gallery upload
- Show detection result + advisory
- Optional history log (Firebase)
- Beautiful Material3 design

---

##  ESP32-CAM Role

- Capture image
- Convert to base64
- POST to Flask backend
- View response on OLED / Serial Monitor
